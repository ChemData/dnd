For the humanoid (humanoidish) mobs are there some low cr animals we could use as pets or war animals?

Ankhegs
- cr 1

Thri-kreen (Do later when they approach the desert)
- cr 0.5 (immature)
- cr 2-3
- cr 4-6

Ogres
- magical ogre?? cr 6

Harpies
- cr 5 (powerful mage?)

Satyr
- Just take humanoid mobs and add satyr effects

Centaur
- A few that are cr 1-8
- Take humanoid mobs and add centaur effects


Vampires

Mutated versions of a bunch of beasts
    - These can be basically the same but bump up the cr by 1 or 2 levels


Monsters that should maybe be in a set??

- Minotaur
- Minotaur skeleton
- Mummy (and related, e.g. skelton, zombie)
- Cyclops
- Sphynix, gynosphinx
- Fiends? Incubus
